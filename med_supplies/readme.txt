Medical Suppply Project:

Make sort of a multiple commoedity (or maybe multiple networks) to connect medical supplies to hospitatls and clinics (esepcially supplies associated with covid related syptoms).

Pros:
-fairly easy network to work with
-relevant to covid and distaster relief in general

Cons:
-Have locations for medical suppliesrs and hospitals, but getting them in teh same coordinate system could be annoying
-will need to find information on supplies available from certain suppliers as well as costs
-might be hard to deteremine need for each hospital unless we only look at sending maybe 2 supplies total. Less reserach would need to be done then.
