# A Wheelie Good Time: Safe Biking in Denver

Welcome to our GitHub repository for Angela Morrison's and Weston Grewe's project A Wheelie Good Time: Safe Biking in Denver for the Auraria Library's Spring 2022 Data to Policy Symposium. To find a detailed narrative of our project please visit [our project page](http://math.ucdenver.edu/~sborgwardt/wiki/index.php/A_Wheelie_Good_Time:_Safe_Biking_in_Denver) on CU Denver's [optimization wiki](http://math.ucdenver.edu/~sborgwardt/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). 

In this repository you can find the shapefile data we used to create a bike network for Denver. In the data_cleaning folder you can find our work preparing the network for analysis.
