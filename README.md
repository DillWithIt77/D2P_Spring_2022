# A Wheelie Good Time: Safe Biking in Denver

Welcome to our GitHub repository for Angela Morrison's and Weston Grewe's project A Wheelie Good Time: Safe Biking in Denver for the Auraria Library's Spring 2022 Data to Policy Symposium. To find a detailed narrative of our project please visit [our project page](http://math.ucdenver.edu/~sborgwardt/wiki/index.php/A_Wheelie_Good_Time:_Safe_Biking_in_Denver) on CU Denver's [optimization wiki](http://math.ucdenver.edu/~sborgwardt/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). 

In this repository you can find the shapefile data we used to create a bike network for Denver. The shapefile data for plotting can be found in the [bike routes folder](https://github.com/DillWithIt77/D2P_Spring_2022/tree/main/bike_routes). In the [Data Cleaning and Plotting](http://github.com/DillWithIt77/D2P_Spring_2022/tree/main/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Plotting) folder you can find our work preparing the network for analysis. Primarily, preprocessing is done in [Build-Network.ipynb](https://github.com/DillWithIt77/D2P_Spring_2022/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Plotting/Build-Network.ipynb).
The analysis for our results is also contained in this foulder in [Bike Lane Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/DillWithIt77/D2P_Spring_2022/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Plotting/Bike%20Lane%20Analysis.ipynb).

The Algorithms used for this project can be found in the [Algorithms](http://github.com/DillWithIt77/D2P_Spring_2022/tree/main/Algorithms) folder. Here we use the standard shortest path and a safety-constrinated shortest path to determine the paths to each of our key destinations: Union Station, Auraria Campus, 5 Points, City Park, and the University of Denver. We then compare the results to determine policy recommendations on where to increase the safety of certain bike paths.
 
 If you would like a more consise summary of our results, checkout out our [D2P Presentation](http://github.com/DillWithIt77/D2P_Spring_2022/blob/main/Presentations/D2P%20Slides.pdf) and our Final Presentation. If for some reason, you only want to see the images contained in our presentation, check out the [Images for Presentation folder](https://github.com/DillWithIt77/D2P_Spring_2022/tree/main/Images%20for%20Presentations).
