# Bike Policy Recommendation

## Introduction

Denver is committed to building more bike lanes. The [Denver Moves program](https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Department-of-Transportation-and-Infrastructure/Programs-Services/Bicycles)
is a policy vision dedicated to building more bike lanes throughout the city. From 2019 to 2021 the city built 74 miles of bike lanes and desires to build
an additional 51 miles by the end of 2023 for a total of 125 miles built in 5 years. 

The Denver Moves: Bicycle Program was sparked because of the cities unwillingness to bike ride. This unwillingness is justified. Denver is a car centric city.
Roads are designed with cars in mind and bicyclists as an afterthought. With that in mind, residents are fearful to bike in the city. In fact, according to
[a survey](https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Department-of-Transportation-and-Infrastructure/Programs-Services/Bicycles)
only 4% of cyclists are highly confident in biking throughout the city. 60% of residents are interested but concerned while 25% rule out cycling completely.
As more than half of the city is interested but concerned, we can see that there is substantiantial room for growth. 

For this Data to Policy project, we use network analysis to determine crucial spots for developing protected bike lanes. We take into account both highly
used roads and areas where development of a bike lane can sharply decrease commute time. We consider commutes to several different city hubs: CU Denver, 
16th Street Mall, Five Points, and University of Denver. These represent 4 parking constrained areas of Denver where many people commute to for work. They
are ideal destinations for people to bike to.
