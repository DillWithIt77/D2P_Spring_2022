Recycling Project Idea:

Use the garbage route data in roder to find neighborhoods for recycling. Deteremine the distance to rcycling locations near them. Do a feasible or max flow to deteremine how much recycling can be done for a low cost.

Pros: 
-recycling is a problem in Denver, so policy would be good.
-fairly easy programming to do for the network

Cons:
-might be hard to clean data to gt into network
-would need to grou pneighborhoods, find their "middle" and also input reyccling center info into same coordiante system
-data fror recycling centers exists, but would be annoying to put into a csv then convert to dataset that is the same as neighborhoods
